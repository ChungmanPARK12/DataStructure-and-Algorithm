# Overview

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this project is to gain a strong understanding of various data structures and algorithms, learn how to implement and handle different methods and systems in C# , and test them using NUnit to ensure their correctness and efficiency.

<h2>Features</h2>

- **Binary Search**
- **Sequential Search**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Node**
- **Linked List**
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **NUnit Testing**

<h2>Debugging Process</h2>

- **Code Review**: Regular reviews and tools like pylint and flake8 ensured code quality.
- **Setting Breakpoints**: Set Breakpoints in the code to start debugging and pressing 'F5'.
- **Stepping Through Code**: Use 'F10' to step over each line of code and 'F11' to step in to methods for detailed.
- **Checking Output**: Utilize 'console.Writeline' statements to print variable and outputs.

# Getting Started
<h2>System Requirements</h2>

To operate this supermarket system, you will need the following:

- **Class Library(.NET Framework)**
- ![NET](https://github.com/ChungmanPARK12/DataStructure-and-Algorithm/assets/162090754/b6777594-ddae-4d2a-8bcb-c2d6d0559822)

<h2>Installation</h2>

- **IDE**: An integrated development environment(IDE) makes development easier [official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- **Visual Studio**: A powerful IDE for Windows and MacOS, which provides extensive feature for C# development. 
- **Visual Studio 2019**: Requires Windows 7 or Windowes 10 recommended.
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Requires Windows 10 or higher.

- **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git https://github.com/ChungmanPARK12/DataStructure-and-Algorithm.git
   cd <Algorithm_and_NUnitTest/Class_Library>

# Alorithms

<h2>Binary Search</h2>
A fast algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, reducing time complexity to O(log n).

<h2>Sequantial Search</h2>
A linear search, involves checking each element of a list one-by-one until the target value is found or the list ends. It has a time complexity of O(n).


* ### Example of Code [Click here](https://github.com/ChungmanPARK12/SequentialSearch.git)

<h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. Its time complexity is O(nÂ²).

* ### Ascending and Descending sort

<h2>Node</h2>
A fundamental unit used to build linked lists, trees, and graphs. It typically contains data and references (or pointers) to other nodes, forming complex structures.

### Traverse Pre Order
* Visit the root node.
* Traverse the left subtree.
* Traverse the right subtree.

### Traverse In Order
* Traverse the left subtree.
* Visit the root node.
* Traverse the right subtree.

### Traverse Post Order
* Traverse the left subtree.
* Traverse the right subtree.
* Visit the root node.
